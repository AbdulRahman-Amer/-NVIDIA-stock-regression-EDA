linear regression
Introduction
A contracting company has a cash that need to invested.
since they don’t have experience investing in technology sector, they asked group of data scientist to make a model that predict what is the price of stock going to be based on many variables
forecasting a stock is challenging task therefore it is needed to be studied with many other variables to minimize the error
NVIDIA stock was set to be studied and its relation with variables such as (Competitors
, video games companies ,crypto currencies , economic performance indexes and others ) in the end the model should be able to forecast the stock price based on given variables
Questions
Forecasting the stock is impossible however getting an estimated value is possible with the condition to use multiple variables affecting the stock
To build such model we need to know
• What are the possible variables affecting the stock?
• How much each variable affects the stock?
• Is there correlation between the variables with each other?
• Do I need to use all variables?
Data
The forecasted stock is NVIDIA stock
For the data used , features were categorized on different types as follows Hardware industry stock: intel and amd
Gaming companies stock: Riot games, Epic games, EA and activation Crypto currency: bitcoin , Ethereum
Economics performance: inflation rate, average income
Others: gold, oil
Tools
• Python and pandas for data manipulation
• statsmodels and sklearn for liner regression analysis
• BeautifulSoap and selenium for webscraping
• Matplotlib and seborn for data visualization
MVP
The MVP should be able to forecast the desired Stock price
